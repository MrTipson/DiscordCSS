 # DiscordCSS

DiscordCSS is a set of css stylesheets that aims to create a more pleasant Discord experience.
It's modularity means that you can mix and match whichever parts you want.

The Discord app needs to be patched, instructions can be found on the project [wiki](https://github.com/MrTipson/DiscordCSS/wiki).
If you're using the web version it should be available via an extension to your browser. Something like [Amino](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amino-live-css-editor/pbcpfbcibpcbfbmddogfhcijfpboeaaf) will do, but you can use anything you 
want.

If you would like me to add a certain functionality, you can make an issue or fork the repo and make a pull request

# Stylesheets
All of the stylesheets are modular. Import each one by writing `@import url("<link>");` at the top of your main css file (example: `@import url("https://mrtipson.github.io/DiscordCSS/theme.css");`.\
Once you have it imported, you can keep the default values or set the variables again to change their values.

Stylesheets are listed, along with images on the wiki page [Stylesheets](https://github.com/MrTipson/DiscordCSS/wiki/Stylesheets).\
Some stylesheets have screenshots of examples for the theme. They can be found in the [examples](examples/).

*Local files can't be opened due to access policies of browsers and discord itself.*
