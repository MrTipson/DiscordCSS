 # DiscordCSS

DiscordCSS is a set of css stylesheets that aims to create a more pleasant Discord experience.
It's modularity means that you can mix and match whichever parts you want.

The Discord app needs to be patched, my suggestion would be [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord), because it only injects CSS (no js). If you're using the web version it should be available at no risk via an extension to your browser that allows custom css to be added to the page. 

*Discord is aware of the existance of client mods but they are technically not allowed. This is something you should be aware of as things could change in the future.*

# Stylesheets
All of the stylesheets are modular. Import each one by writing `@import url("<link>");` at the top of your main css file (example: `@import url("https://mrtipson.github.io/DiscordCSS/theme.css");`.\
Once you have it imported, you can keep the default values or set the variables again to change their values.

Stylesheets are listed, along with images on the wiki page [Stylesheets](https://github.com/MrTipson/DiscordCSS/wiki/Stylesheets).\
Some stylesheets have screenshots of examples for the theme. They can be found in the [examples](examples/).

*Local files can't be opened due to access policies of browsers and discord itself.*
